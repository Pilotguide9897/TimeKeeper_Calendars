# TimeKeeper_Calendars

## Description

This app is designed as a web-based workday scheduler. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides a simple and intuitive user interface for scheduling appointments and tasks during a typical business days. This scheduler consists of rows, each representing a specific hour of the work day, from 9AM to 5PM. Each row contains three columns: the hour, a text area for entering a description or task for that hour, and a save button. This application uses JavaScript to dynamically update the app with the current date and time, as well as adding and removing "past", "present", and "future" classes to the rows based on the comparison between the hour in the row's ID and the current hour to allow the app to display the rows in different colours depending on whether the hour is in the past, present, or future. The JavaScript also allows the application to be able to store and retrieve data surrounding the user's tasks and appointments to keep track of them even when app is closed.
