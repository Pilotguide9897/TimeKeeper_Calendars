# TimeKeeper_Calendars

## Description

This app is designed as a web-based work day scheduler. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides a simple and intuitive user interface for scheduling appointments and tasks during a typical work day. This scheduler consists of rows, each representing a specific hour of the work day, from 9AM to 5PM. Each row contains three columns: the hour, a text area for entering a description or task for that hour, and a save button.

This application uses JavaScript updating the app with the current date and time, as well as adding and removing "past", "present", and "future" classes to the rows based on the comparison between the hour in the row's ID and the current hour to allow the app to display the rows in different colours depending on whether the hour is in the past, present, or future. The JavaScript also allows the application to be storing and retrieving data surrounding the user's tasks and appointments to keep track of them even when app is closed.

The deployed application may be accessed here.
